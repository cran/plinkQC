Description: Genotyping arrays enable the direct measurement of an individuals
    genotype at thousands of markers. 'plinkQC' facilitates genotype quality
    control for genetic association studies as described by Anderson and
    colleagues (2010) <doi:10.1038/nprot.2010.116>. It makes 'PLINK' basic
    statistics (e.g. missing genotyping rates per individual, allele frequencies
    per genetic marker) and relationship functions accessible from 'R' and
    generates a per-individual and per-marker quality control report.
    Individuals and markers that fail the quality control can subsequently be
    removed to generate a new, clean dataset. Removal of individuals based on
    relationship status is optimised to retain as many individuals as possible
    in the study.
